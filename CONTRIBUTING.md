## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Development

### Requirements

* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
* [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) for your favorite IDE

### Configuration

Get the merged platformio.ini configuration for debugging:

```bash
pio project config
```

Get default environment:

```bash
pio project config --json-output | jq -cr '.[0][1][0][1]'
```

Result: `["heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3_HCSR04"]`

### Build & Upload

Build the project:

```bash
pio run --environment <environment>
```

Build and upload the project:

```bash
pio run --target upload --environment <environment>
```

## Debug level

The debug level can be set in the `platformio.ini` file.

```ini
[env:heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3_HCSR04]
```

| `docs` | Documentation only changes | patch |
| `style` | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

| `perf` | A code change that improves performance | patch |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests | patch |
| `chore` | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation | patch |

### Release management

We use [release please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for this project.
It is implemented in our [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).
It collects all commits since the last release in a release pull request.
Use the [conventional commit](#conventional-commits) message format for your commits like it is described above.
Please write your messages very easy to understand for none developers and a bit more
verbose as useally because it will be used for the Changelog and Release-Notes.

### Workflow for your new feature

1. Create a new branch `feature/sensor-xvz`
2. Develop your feature in your feature branch
3. Create a pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch
4. Address any review comments
5. Merge the pull request once it is approved and delete your feature branch
6. If not allready done, *please release* will automatically create a new release pull request. This pull request will include your changes.
7. To create a new release, you have to merge the release pull request into the master

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A((Create new branch))-->B-->Q;
    B[/Create Pull Request/]-->C;
    Q[[Build binary]]-->B;
    C(Review)-->D;
    D((Merge in Master));
```

### Workflow for new releases

1. Merge everthing into the main branch
2. An release pull request will be created automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Check the release pull request and merge it into the main branch

```mermaid

    B[[Creates Release Pull Request]]-->C;
    Q(Build binary)-->B;

    D[[Creates Tag and Release]]-->E;
    E[[Uploads binaries to release]];
```
