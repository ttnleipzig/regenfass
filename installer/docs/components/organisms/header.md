- Features the Regenfass brand name with gradient text styling
- Includes fixed navigation links to documentation, GitHub, and Matrix
- Navigation is hidden on mobile devices (`hidden md:block`)
- Integrates the ModeToggle component for dark/light theme switching
- Uses responsive layout with max-width container and proper spacing
- Gradient text uses sky-600 to cyan-100 for brand recognition
