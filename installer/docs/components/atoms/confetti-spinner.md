- Four confetti pieces positioned around the spinner with staggered delays
- Each confetti piece uses different colors (red, blue, green, yellow)
- Container is 128x128px (w-32 h-32) with centered content
- Perfect for success states or celebratory loading scenarios
- Uses `animate-bounce` for confetti movement with varying delays
